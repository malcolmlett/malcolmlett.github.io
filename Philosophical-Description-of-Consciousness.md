It turns out that Consciousness is nothing like what we thought it was. This article attempts to describe what it is, what it is not, and why it was necessary for it to evolve.

tbd: an article that focuses on trying to prove why I believe my theory. 

# Logical Inaccuracy
Biology is a deeply flawed way of creating a reliable, accurate computing engine. Evolutionary processes inherently introduce errors, and approximations. The network of neurons that our ability to learn and think depends on, depends on approximations. It's approximations start with high inaccuracy, and improve over time, but there is no boundary line between being untrained and trained. 

Thus, for a biologically based computing engine, every step is inaccurate and unreliable, and every step must cope with that error. 

It turns out that this error-prone nature is what leads to such overall adaptability. When every component must be adaptable in the face of high error rates, the aggregate is capable of amazing things. That aggregate is capable of not just adapting to our surroundings and changing social structures, but it's able to adapt to different methods of thinking. 

A little example:
* If you combine multiple unreliable components together, such that their errors are multiplied, you very quickly converge towards zero accuracy. But if you verify one component against another, you can increase the overall accuracy. The likelihood of two 90% accurate components both being wrong is only 1%.

# Conscious from the Ground Up
With such an error prone architecture, how is it possible to execute step by step logical thought? The behaviour of thinking becomes a learned activity too, in much the same way that we learn to control our limbs through trial and observation.

Consciousness is a sense, in just the same way our standard 5 senses are. We are continually fed information about the state of our thoughts. 

At first we have no control. We learn to recognise some meaning from the stream of noise, just like we gradually learn to recognise patterns and correlates associated with our touch sense.

Eventually, almost by accident, we discover that we can control our thought in small ways. As we learn to control our limbs, we mostly send chaotic signals to our limb muscles, and eventually we recognise a correlation between the signals we have sent and their effect. The same goes for learning to control our thoughts.
