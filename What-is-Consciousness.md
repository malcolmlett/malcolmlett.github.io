The word "Consciousness" can mean many different things to different people, in different contexts.

# What does "Consciousness" mean to me?
I use consciousness specifically to refer to the parts of a system that produce these phenomena:
* awareness of thought - the fact that the system can observe its own 'thought' and has 'meta thought' (can think about its own thoughts)
* experience of experiencing - the system has that subtle, hard to explain, human sensation of there being something in our heads that observes all of this. In contrast to a mechanical or electronic machine, for which we have no scientific rational reason to believe it experiences anything.

# But Consciousness is just an illusion .... and other theories
There are a number of theories on what human consciousness is, and what produces it. Like many, I fall into a particular camp and I don't find any of the other theories convincing.

Some alternative theories of consciousness:
* It's an illusion
   * Our detailed mental model makes it think it exists in a palpable way, in the same way that our mental model of our body makes us think our missing limb still exists (Phantom limb syndrome).
* It's an (emanation)   (todo: what's that word?)
* It's a mystical spiritual entity that's somehow linked to our corporal brain.
* The "Hard problem of consciousness" is not a hard problem

Some of the issues I have with the various theories:
* Appeal to complexity.
   * Basically just putting ones hands up and saying, "I don't know, it's too hard, presumably it just happens once it's complex enough".
* Not recognising the significance of the "experience of experiencing"
* Scope and ability of the attached spiritual entity is too limited by the capability of the biological brain. eg: effects of brain damage, sleep.
* The lack of an explained _mechanism_ for creating the phenomenon of "experience of experiencing".
