Dear Editor,

Please consider my research paper titled "Meta-management as a clearer explanation of consciousness" for publication in Neuroscience of Consciousness.

The manuscript describes how the low-level meta-cognitive process of meta-management is a necessary evolutionary adaption to support deliberation, and how it can be used to explain three key phenomenological aspects of consciousness: that it only has access to limited aspects of computational state, that it "looks through" to first-order states, and its timelines/causal nature. While no individual part of the research presented is entirely new, I believe this to be the first attempt to clearly pull together key ideas of evolutionary need, the computational principles underlying deliberation, a concrete mechanism for performing meta-management, and how those lead to the phenomenology of consciousness. I believe the paper also has implications for understanding flexible human-level intelligence in general.

I have been independently researching the topic of consciousness part time since 2014. As such, while I have endeavoured to ensure that this submission is of a professional quality, I lack the support of experienced researchers and some of this submission may be a little "rough around the edges". I look forward to the review process.

I declare that this manuscript is original, has not been published before and is not currently being considered for publication elsewhere.

I know of no conflicts of interest associated with this publication, and there has been no financial support for this work that could have influenced its outcome.

As sole author, I confirm that this manuscript is approved for submission.
