# Consciousness

I've been wondering about human consciousness since 2014. In particular I'm interested in what creates the "experience of experiencing", more typically referred to as "phenomenal experience". I seem to observe every thought I make; why do I not just silently process data like a machine? Why is that observation of thought necessary, and what is the thing that does the observing?
