## Components
Consciousness is split out into the following components:
* Conscious Feedback Control Loop - required in order to govern high-level thought
* Mechanics - what are the physical mechanisms that define and create the 3 other components
* Experiential Content - what data do we experience
* Thing that Experiences - this is the only remaining fundamental question

## Putting it all together
Explain experience of consciousness in terms of:
* senses,
* sense labelling
* mental model
* integration
* meta-thought events,

## Issues
Arbitrary why we observe some data flowing through the system and not others.

## Also
tbd. Copy in discussion (probably on Evernote) about possible explanation of what defines the arbitrary set of data that forms the 'Content' of conscious experience.
