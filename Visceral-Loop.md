[WORK IN PROGRESS]

Loop:
1. processors receive and process input data
2. thalamic symbiote selects data
3. processors identify which data was selected and process the fact that that data was selected, outputting the fact of that selection as new data
4. thalamic symbiote selects that as data for transmission
5. processors identify that "self" makes data selections

While it does not explain the phenomenon of experience, it fully explains the effect of us experiencing consciousness and how/why we subsequently process that experience.

Q: what can this be used for?
* The loop is a simple process cycle and can be applied anywhere.

The Analogy of the Thalamic Symbiote provided a framework that helped to introspect the boundaries and properties of consciousness. The Visceral Loop is one possible mechanism that produces those characteristics.

# Meta-problem of Consciousness
...tbd


## Meta and Meta-meta Thought
Thought -> meta-thought: control loop -> meta-meta-thought: meta-awareness. 

We are aware of our own thoughts, but more than that, we are aware of our awareness. That is the crux of our conclusion that we are conscious.

# Phenomena anecdotes
## Post-hoc awareness of decisions
Visceral loop explains why fRMI studies have shown that we become aware of a decision after its made. Because it takes iterations to consciously become aware of the decision and think about the fact it was made. In short : we can only think about one thing at a time. So the decision and thinking about the decision require separate steps. 

## Sleep
When going under general anaesthetic, we lose our sense of time. We seem to experience ourselves waking up immediately after sleeping. This is different to sleep, where we have some sense of time passing. Clearly, the generic anaesthetic disables some internal time tracking that is otherwise available during sleep......[but why did I think this was relevant to visceral loop?]

# Formalism of Consciousness
Presented here is a first attempt towards a mathematical formalism of consciousness.

One concludes themselves as conscious if they can conclude that:
* `∃ t: I am conscious of t`

In order to conclude that one is conscious of some `t`, some prerequisites must be met and a number of algorithmic steps must be carried out. The steps follow the three iterations of the visceral loop.

Iteration 1:

1. a sense input is processed, producing `t`: some output conclusion, decision, action, or intermediate logical step

Iteration 2:

2. prerequisite: `t` is present (in model)
3. prerequisite: `t` is sourced from 'I'  (as indicated through sense labeling)
4. prerequisite: ∃ memory of producing `t` in past thought
5. `t` is selected as point of attention for processing, producing: i) fact of presence of `t`, ii) relationship of `t` to 'I'

Iteration 3
