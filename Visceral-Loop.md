[WORK IN PROGRESS]

Loop:
1. processors receive and process input data
2. thalamic symbiote selects data
3. processors identify which data was selected and process the fact that that data was selected, outputting the fact of that selection as new data
4. thalamic symbiote selects that as data for transmission
5. processors identify that "self" makes data selections

While it does not explain the phenomenon of experience, it fully explains the effect of us experiencing consciousness and how/why we subsequently process that experience.

The loop is a simple process cycle and can be applied anywhere.

Q: what can this be used for?

The Analogy of the Thalamic Symbiote provided a framework that helped to introspect the boundaries and properties of consciousness. The Visceral Loop is one possible mechanism that produces those characteristics.
