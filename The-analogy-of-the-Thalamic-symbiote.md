In neuroscience, the Thalamus is a small central region of the brain that is understood to have the role of transferring raw sense inputs to other brain regions for filtering and processing, and for receiving those processed senses. Neuroscience is starting to form the conclusion that the Thalamus receives processed data in a high-level representation and is where ultimate decision making is made. Combining that with understanding with observations of our own conscious experience, it seems plausible that the Thalamus is the seat of human consciousness. This articles presents that theory in the form of an analogy of the Thalamus as existing in a symbiotic relationship with the rest of the brain.

## Analogy
Imagine the Thalamus as a separate entity that, through DNA combination, has evolved to live in a symbiotic relationship with the rest of the brain, herein referred to as the Human brain. The Thalamus defers most of the heavy lifting to the Human brain: sense processing, mental and physical skills learning, storage of mental state (ie: working memory), context enrichment via mental models of body and mind, and high-level thought processes that offer up suggestions for next steps in a thought sequence. The Human brain presents all of that to the Thalamus in simplified high-level representations. In turn, the Thalamus uses the high-level representations to make the ultimate decisions in terms of attention, and choosing between multiple potential thought strategies.

In this analogy, the Human brain is an unconscious learning and environment prediction engine with a large capacity for retaining new learnings and mental skills. While the Thalamus is a conscious high-level decision engine that is capable of great adaptability of thought, but which is considerably limited in its scope for growth.Imagine that the Thalamus has its own senses, just like the larger human organism, and conscious experience occurs as the Thalamus observes the high-level representations supplied to its senses. For now, we assume that the conscious feedback loop is a sense like any other, supplied to the Thalamus as a summary of the mental state stored within the Human brain. The Thalamus also has outputs, which control the behaviours of the Human brain; however, the Thalamus does not experience those outputs in the way that it experiences its input senses. Likewise, the Thalamus does not experience its own internal logic processes.

Now, what's interesting here is that experience occurs exactly at the interface where the Human brain supplies data to the Thalamus' input senses.Two closely related conclusions can be drawn from this:
* The content of experience is defined entirely by the data supplied to the input sense of the Thalamus. No other data processing in the Thalamus or Human brain is involved in experience.
* Due to the severe limitations of what remains for conscious experience, it's seems most likely that the whole of conscious experience is encapsulated in the content of that data. Other other words, conscious experience is an artifact of the fact that the Thalamus' input senses receive a triad of raw data + meaning + context.

## Filling out the Analogy
So the human body has 5 raw nerve senses, while the Thalamus has 6 high-level senses, each with the following three pieces of information:
* raw-ish sense data
* meaning labels - eg: object detection in visual senses; sentence understanding in auditory senses
* context labels - eg: mental body model of location of touch; mental mind model of source of conscious feedback.

With such labeling in place, it can be understood how those 6 thalamic senses can be re-purposed for other human internal body and mind senses and states that otherwise do not fit exactly the typical 5 external physical senses:
* Inner voices are generated and subsequently interpreted by internal context processing, labeled as "internal thought" by mental models, and finally received by the Thalamus' auditory sense input.
* Headache pain is interpreted as 'touch' sense, labeled with location in the head by mental body models, and received by the Thalamus' touch sense input.
* Hunger is indicated by the vagus nerve, interpreted as a 'touch' sense, labeled with location in the stomach by mental body models, and received by the Thalamus' touch sense input.
* Intention of action only becomes aware to us via conscious feedback, labeled as internal thought.

## Properties of Experience
Some other properties worth discussing:
* Parallel - the thalamic senses are received in parallel, as independent senses, rather than being combined into a single sequential combination of multi-plexed senses. This conclusion is based on self-observations, and the fact that it makes sense for them to be handled via separate input processing within the Thalamus, and for the Thalamus to be able to apply attention direction after receiving the inputs.
* Repurposing - Thalamic senses are limited to the 6. As the examples above show, many internal body and mind are fed into one or more of those 6, repurposing them beyond the scope of just the external physical senses.

## Conclusions
The analogy presented here frames the peculiarities of experiential vs non-experiential processing in a self-consistent model by treating the Thalamus as its own separate entity, existing in a symbiotic relationship with the Human part of the brain. It helps us define some properties of conscious experience, specifically: i) triad of raw-ish + meaning + context data, ii) limited in scope to 6 thalamic input senses only, iii), limited to the human-thalamic interface, iv) occurs in parallel, v) repurposed for other human internal senses.

None of this explains why an arbitrary subset of neurons being supplied high-level representations of processed senses somehow creates EOE.
