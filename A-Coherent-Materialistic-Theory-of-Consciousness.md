Abstract:
- Consciousness is produced by a semiotic multi-step planner state machine with meta management. 

This article is interested in resolving the most perplexing question of consciousness..... In an attempt at being as precise as possible, I use the term "subjective experience". Necessary to deflect from our own intuitions and biases and connotations associated with words used in discussion of Cs. Here, we are interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying subjective experience. What produces subjective experience? Why might some structures produce subjective experience while others might not? What are the sufficient and necessary conditions for subjective experience?

Many extent theories invoke non-Materialistic mechanisms. Here I present the case that CS can be fully explained through materialistic means. It just requires that we understand some of how General Intelligence works. 

Some provide mechanistic explanations, but often either only at a philosophical level or only provide part of the story. In many respects, the skill of a researcher in this area is to sieve through the many partial stories and see how they can be linked together. This paper attempts just that. None of the ideas are entirely new. But I believe this to be the most comprehensive attempt to combine theories together at the most detailed level.

# Part I - Background

What is consciousness? This a question that has been considered for a long time. When Chalmers now famously re-phrased it as the "hard problem of consciousness", he went so far as to claim that no currently known mechanism can produce the phenomenon of subjective experience.

_Todo later: extend out as suitable intro for someone totally new to the question._


# I.1 Theories of Consciousness

Many theories exist about the nature of consciousness. A summary of such theories will be given here. To provide some uniformity, the explanatory framework of a stack of theoretical layers is used, illustrated in the following diagram. Here, the physical biology of the brain is viewed as a substrate that might potentially be replaced or emulated via some other substrate (eg: silicon neurons). Built upon that substrate are many non-conscious processes. Either directly from the underlying substrate, or as a result of the non-conscious processes, some mental states are associated with subjective experience. The blue boxes represent potential layers involved in that subjective experience. For example, some non-conscious processes may produce representations that are associated with subjective experience. Such representations may or may not require specific functional structures in order to lead to subjective experience. Additionally, even with appropriate functional structures, something extra special may or may not be needed in order for those representations to be associated with subjective experience.

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Layers common to many theories of consciousness.</b> Theories of consciousness can be discussed in terms of which of these stacked layers that they focus on. Many theories focus on just one of these layers</i></li>
</ul>

**Substrate:** Everything is constructed within a physical substrate such as biological neurons. Identity Theory posits that there may be something special about biological neurons that give rise to subjective experience; or in other words, that functional isomorphisms of biological neurons such as silicon neurons or computer simulated neurons will never produce subjective experience. Inspired by the peculiar behaviour of quantum mechanics, some have suggested that the physical substrate produces quantum entanglement and that this quantum entanglement may be the underlying mechanism behind subjective experience, such as  ...{insert name of Microtubules theory}.... Such theories are quiet on which of the other layers are required. Those theories bare some similarity to that of Pan-Psychism, the theory that consciousness is fundamental in the same way that physical forces and energies are fundamental. Under Pan-psychism, some non-conscious processes lead directly to subjective experience with pan-psychist properties providing the "something special" without necessarily requiring specific representations or functional structures. However, pan-psychism is unable to explain why only certain processes are associated with subjective experience while others are not. An obvious explanation would be to require that only certain representations and associated functional structures are sufficient to "combine" the conscious properties of independent neurons / molecules / atoms, but this still leads many open questions about what those representations and/or functional structures might be that have such a power over this underlying fundamental consciousness.

**Non-conscious processes:** Many processes operate that neither directly nor indirectly lead to any kind of conscious subjective experience. While earlier work assumed that most brain processes are conscious, there is increasingly strong evidence that almost all mental processes are non-conscious, even for mental processes that are associated with attentive subjective experience. The furthest logical extension is that of epi-phenomenalism which posits that no functional mental processes are associated with subjective experience. Rather, subjective experience is posited as being some sort of non-causal summary of internal and external events. A significant problem with epi-phenomenalism is why subjective experience, and indeed consciousness at all, would have evolved if it can provide no functional / causal benefit to the individual. In that sense, epi-phenomenalism only makes any sense if viewed in conjunction with pas-psychism or with metaphysical dualistic theories where some "spirit" that exists on another plane of reality are perceiving the experiences for some grander purpose outside of the context of the corporeal reality.

**Representation:** Under Computational Representation Theories of Consciousness, some of those non-conscious processes produce representations that are associated with subjective experience. Debates within this area are about the kinds of these representations. For example, the intransitive vs transitive debate questions whether it is sufficient that a representation is simply held in attention or whether the representation must be in relation to the individual.......{needs work and better tie-back to actual theories}....

- Reference: https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy-of-mind/Qualitative-states#ref283994

**Functional Structures:** The next question arises about why certain representations would have subjective experience and others would not. Is it sufficient that a particular kind of representation exists for it to be associated with subjective experience, or does that representation need to occur in conjunction with particular functional structures? For example, imagine that all aspects of the brain were understood to the point that we could identify exactly which representations are associated with subjective experience. Now imagine that an exact replica of a particular representation was encoded within the gates of a silicon memory chip within a computer. Most would argue that the silicon memory chip does not subsequently have subjective experience of that representation, because a representational state alone is insufficient for subjective experience. Some kind of functional structure presumably must be required to observe that representation. But if functional structures are indeed required, what are those functional structures? And what distinguishes those functional structures that are associated with subjective experience and those that are not? Once again here it can be hard to avoid the pitfall of infinite regress: if a representation must be interpreted in order to be perceived, and a functional structure is required in order to interpret that representation, what is the output of that interpretation if it is not just another representation needing to be further interpreted?

**Something Special:** A deeper philosophical debate rages about whether representation and functional structures alone are sufficient to produce subjective experience, or whether something else is required. In the example below, if all the representational and functional structures are in place for an individual to have both the external behaviours and internal mental behaviours of an individual in intense pain, can we even conceive it to be possible that they would not have the typical associated subjective experience of the pain?

> Suppose that, in order to avoid the risks to his patient of anaesthesia, a resourceful surgeon finds a way of temporarily depriving the patient of whatever nonfunctional condition the critic of functionalism insists on, while keeping the functional organization of the patient’s brain intact. As the surgeon proceeds with, say, a massive abdominal operation, the patient’s functional organization might lead him to think that he is in acute pain and to very much prefer that he not be, even though the surgeon assures him that he could not be in pain because he has been deprived of precisely “what it takes.” It is hard to believe that even the most ardent qualiaphile would be satisfied by such assurances.

One particular area of debate falls variously under the terms "Cartesian theatre" or "homunculus problem". The Cartesian Theatre ..introduced by ....describes the interactions between supposedly two parts of the mind: the part that has subjective experience (the audience in the theatre), and the part that produces the contents of subjective experience (the actors in the theatre). This has also been described as a "homunculus" or "little man" inside the brain that has the experiences. Both descriptions pose a problem: that the audience/homonculus requires a significant level of intelligence in order to interpret and understand the show being put on; but that same intelligence is required to produce the show in the first place. In the case of homunculus, we can provide two descriptions w.r.t. to the layers described above. In the first description, the non-conscious processes produce a representation that is perceived by the homunculus. Here the problem becomes what mechanisms the homunculus uses to do that perceiving? In the second description, the representation is sufficiently processed by functional structures so that no further processing is required, and that final result is simply perceived-without-processing. In practice this raises more questions than it seeks to address. What kind of thing is it that can perceive-without-processing? In response, the theory of semiotics (discussed in a section below) claims that it is impossible for such a thing to exist, because there is no perception without interpretation, and interpretation necessarily involves processing.

Ned Block and various other's variations propose that consciousness is divided into access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness, and that access-consciousness variously stops somewhere below the "something special" layer, with various arguments about where it stops. Such arguments down to differences in opinion about the relation between access and phenomenal consciousness: i) are they one-to-one: all access conscious events have phenomenal consciousness, ii) can some access conscious events lead to external behaviour without the individual having subjective experience?, or iii) can some phenomenal conscious events occur that have no access consciousness: for example that the individual experiences in the moment but cannot have any memory of it and cannot report on it.

# II.4 Interlude: Environment, Body, and Cognitive Processes

Before continuing, it'll be useful to do a deep dive into the interactions between the three key systems of: external environment, body, and the cognitive processes. This is key because it explains the importance of independent modelling of env, body and CP, and thus why "I" becomes so prominent in the computation that produces subjective experience.

With respect to an embodied individual, three interacting systems are typically assumed: external environment, body, and mind. In an attempt to be a little more precise, this article uses the term _"cognitive processes"_ (CPs) instead of _"mind"_. In any case, while these systems provide a useful basis for discussion, their exact distinction can become blurred. So some effort is first required to define them more clearly.

## Classification

In attempting to define the delineation between these three systems, it is important to take a particular perspective: that of evolution. The most simple organisms lack a nervous system but nevertheless have evolved to react sufficiently well in order for their species to continue. We can say with some certainty that they lack cognitive processes of any sort, but they do have a clear delineation between their body and the environment around them - that delineation usually being a semi-permeable membrane. Evolutionary forces have produced such an organism to act in a way that it mostly protects itself from danger long enough to produce offspring. With some organisms, such as jelly fish, a nervous system has evolved that improves the ability of that organism to meet its homeostatic needs (eg: feeding), to protect itself from danger, and to procreate. The nervous system is entirely there to meet the needs of the body as a whole - those same same needs that applied to simple organisms lacking a nervous system. In mammals that nervous system is largely centralised into the brain as a discrete organ and in some cases that brain acts to look after its own homeostatic needs independent of the direct needs of the rest of the body.

So the nervous system is just a part of the body in the same way that a limb is. There is no need to be confused about body vs mind, as in truth the mind is just a physical brain, which is a subset of the body.

It is useful however to treat the processes and states of the brain/main as separate from the rest of the body, so they we can analyse the interactions between the subsystem of the brain/mind against the other subsystems of the rest of the body. This article draws such a distinction.

Thus we have:

||Environment|Body|Cognitive Processes (CPs)|
|--|--|--|--|
|Description|All people and things external to the physical body of the individual.|The physical form of the individual in its entirety, including head and brain.|A part of the Body. Computational processes that operate within the nervous system of the body.|
|State|Environment State|Body State|Variously referred to as Cognitive State or CP State.|
|Actions||_Body Actions_ include: any externally observable actions, hormone released from anywhere except the brain. Body Actions exclude: actions performed directly by the Cognitive Processes.|_Cognitive Actions_ include: sending nerve signals to control body actions, changing cognitive state, hormone release from the brain.|

During discussions that follow it will often be necessary to place cognitive processes and their underlying neural basis in juxtaposition with the rest of the body. In general I try to use the phrase "rest of the body" to make that clear, but in some cases that becomes too cumbersome and the term _Body_ implicitly assumes the meaning "rest of the body". This is particularly the case for the term _Body Actions_, which are always assumed to exclude those actions which are better categorised as _Cognitive Actions_.

With that said, let's examine what these three systems can do:

![env, body, and CP high level](files/A-coherent-theory-v1-env-body-cp-why.drawio.png)

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Some pathways of how the environment, body, and cognitive processes are leveraged to support the needs of the body.</b> Solid arrows indicate the most significant relationships, with dotted arrows indicating supporting processes.</i></li>
</ul>

**Environment:**
- The environment is a source of nourishment, of pleasure, and of danger. Some components of the environment (eg: family members) have a vested interest in helping the individual. While others (eg: predators and bacteria) have a vested interest in using the body of the individual in ways that would be detrimental to the survival of the individual.
- For most interactions the size and stability of the environment outweighs any ability for the individual to manipulate it. Thus the individual may manipulate the environment in a small localised way in order to meet the needs of the individual. The individually generally does not need to also consider the homeostatic needs of the environment itself. But in some situations the individual will need to consider the environment's homeostatic needs and act accordingly; for example to water the food crops before they die, or to act nicely to other individuals in order to keep them as friends.
- In the discussions that follow, we assume a simplified model whereby the individual acts in relation to the environment only in terms of their own immediate needs. But that is not intended to imply that those other important interactions do not exist.

**Body:**
- The body's most obvious actions are those that can be externally observed, such as those it performs via its limbs. The individual performs actions using these devices and in so doing changes the state of its body, eg: the left arm was hanging down but is now held upright. In some cases the action also changes the state of the environment, eg: by pulling a fruit from a tree branch.
- The body also performs more subtle actions, including using the eye and neck muscles to change where it is looking. In that sense, body actions can be performed due to some need that is more directly related to cognitive processes than to the immediate state of the rest of the body. These range from the innocuous (eg: idly looking around while day-dreaming) to the urgent (eg: looking to see whether the unexpected sound signifies danger). Thus, the body can perform actions that influence the cognitive processes. 
- Another kind of body action is the release of hormones by endocrine glands distributed around the body. These include the thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal glands, kidneys, pancreas, ovaries and uterus (females) or testes (males). As discussed earlier, for the purposes of the discussions in this article, hormones released from the brain are arbitrarily attributed to CP rather than to the body.
- Body actions are performed for a number of broad reasons:
  - to meet immediate homeostatic needs of the body excluding cognitive processes, eg:
    - the need to maintain body temperature near an ideal level
    - the need to maintain energy levels
    - the need to sleep when the body requires it
  - to meet immediate homeostatic needs of the cognitive processes (more on this later),
  - goals that the individual has decided upon, eg:
    - to seek a partner for procreation
    - to explore the far mountain
    - to build a hut

**Cognitive Processes:**
- Arguably the most important role of CP is to take all of the raw information obtained from sensory nerves distributed throughout the body, to infer the state of the body and the state of the environment, to infer the necessary body actions to take, and to coordinate the many body muscles and organs in the execution of those body actions.
- The brain also contains endocrine glands that produce hormones and which have direct impacts on both the body and the cognitive processes. These include the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the pineal gland.
- But CP is now sufficiently complex that it has its own homeostatic needs. Eg: to stop unnecessary processing in order to minimise energy usage, to avoid chaotic processing for it's negative effects on learning, to stabilise attention control. In addition, the mind is complex enough that it can execute goals that don't directly involve the body - eg: solving maths problems for the sake of learning. 
- Jobs:
  - monitor and infer body state
  - coordination of body actions
  - release of brain-based hormones
  - infer and control mind actions to meet homeostatic and goal needs of body
    - monitor and infer cognitive state
    - infer and control cognitive actions to meet homeostatic and goal needs of body
    - infer and control cognitive actions to meet the homeostatic and goal needs of the mind
- So cognitive actions are performed for a number of broad reasons:
  - to meet immediate homeostatic needs of the body excluding cognitive processes
  - to meet immediate homeostatic needs of the cognitive processes
  - goals that the individual has decided upon

## System Interactions

![env, body, and CP interactions](files/A-coherent-theory-v1-env-body-cp.drawio.png)

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Environment, body, and CP interactions.</b> todo - description.</i></li>
</ul>

[Braindump] Points on above diagram:
- Body and CPs have their own homeostatic needs and in many cases this requires CPs to coordinate the necessary actions and other processes to meet those homeostatic needs.
- Individual's goals may relate specifically to something in the body sense (eg: "I want to move into the shade to cool down"), to something specifically in the CP sense (eg: "I want to be better at problem solving"), or have elements of both (eg: "I want to go to a cafe to study").
- The state of the environment is inferred by CPs based on information obtained via the 5 senses and from past learnings. Such inference has low certainty because the 5 senses provide only minimal information about the environment, and thus there are many hidden (unobserved) variables.
- The state of the body is inferred by CPs based on information obtained via the 5 senses, via internal senses such as proprioception and hunger, and from past learnings about the body. Such inference has a moderate certainty. The individual can act with high confidence regarding the broad high-level location and orientation of its limbs, for example. But the individual has very limited information about the internal workings of the body across its many scales. For example, often only a trained physician can identify the cause when an individual experiences pain within the area of the abdomen. There is significant room for variation on the amount of information that could be obtained about body processes, but not without cost. For example, any increase in information acquisition carries costs of a) extra energy expenditure, b) extra space taken up by additional nerves, c) extra processing capacity required in order to accurately infer based on the larger informational dimensionality. Thus the amount of information known about the body is a trade-off that is balanced through evolutionary pressures.
- The state of CPs are inferred through the meta-management feedback loop and from past learnings and modelling of the individual's own CPs. Like for the body, there is a trade-off associated with variations in the amount of information acquired about cognitive state. This is especially obvious for the case of CPs gaining information about themselves. The more CPs state that is acquired, the larger the brain must be to infer based on that acquired information. The larger and more complex the brain, the greater the amount of CPs state that might need to be acquired. Thus, necessarily, the amount of information obtained by CPs about their own processes is minimal, and the associated inference of that state carries only moderate certainty at best - something akin to knowing the broad high-level location and orientation of a limb, without knowing anything of the individual muscles, nerves, ligaments involved with holding the limb in that state.
- The level of control that the individual has over the environment is minimal, and tends to carry a high energy and time expense. Additionally, the certainty that an individual has that they will be able to obtain the desired environment state is low, eg: that a branch over their head will prevent rain from falling on them.
- The individual has full control over the state of their body, disregarding low-level molecular breakdown processes and quantum uncertainty. Most of that control is carried out automatically by the body without CPs, through localised biological processes controlled by DNA. A small selection of high order body actions are controlled by CPs. The level of energy and time expenditure associated with body control varies significantly, with most localised biological processes operating very efficiently, while some large scale outwardly observable actions requiring significant energy and time expenditure (eg: running). Those automatic biological processes probably have a fairly high accuracy in their ability to effect the desired outcome. On the other hand, the ability for CPs to control body state carries some uncertainty. Every action initiated via nerve signals from the brain occurs over a period of time and is affected by many dynamic factors, including: i) whether the individual is experiencing normal, above normal, or below normal levels of energy at the time, ii) whether some unexpected resistance is affecting movement of limbs (eg: tight fitting clothes), iii) uncertainty in the inference of body state, and iv) uncertainty in inference in the environment state that might affect body action (eg: an unseen stick that trips the individual while walking).
- The individual also has full control over the state of its CPs. Similarly for the body, many of those CPs are controlled in a localised manner. For example, there is evidence that raw optical nerve signals are initially normalised via an entirely localised process .......[citation and details]............ While the brain uses about 20% of oxygen availability within the body [citation], in general we can say that CPs are relatively effortless in comparison to large-scale body actions. Thus, it is usually more energy and time efficient to imagine many possible actions and their outcomes before choosing the appropriate body action, than it is to physically act out all of those possible actions. But CP effort is not negligeable. The level of certainty associated with a CP action is harder to quantify, but is probably relatively high.
- Environment, body, and CP state affect each other, leading to additional indirect pathways for the individual to control state of those systems. Body actions against the environment change the environment state, which can indirectly change the body state; eg: building a house to keep warm. CP actions against the body change the body state, which can indirectly change CP state, eg: turning away from a disturbing sight in order to direct attention away from it.

## Markov Process Modelling

With such significant differences between the behaviours, predictability, and level of control over each environment, body, and CP, a key feature of any models regarding them will be to distinguish between those three systems. For any given sense and associated inferred hidden state, whether that state is primarily associated with the environment, the body, or with CP has a significant impact on how certain the individual can be about the accuracy of the inference, and about the likelihood that the individual will be able to change the hidden state to a more favourable one.

That information is of particular relevance to meta-management processes. In order for meta-management processes to operate efficiently, they need to operate against a higher-order approximation. Some investigation into how those processes may operate illustrates this point.

An agent observing and interacting with an environment can model that environment with a markov process such as illustrated below in panel A: a set of `n` actions are possible, and many combinations are possible. Those actions influence `j` hidden states in complex ways. The agent make makes an observation containing `q` features. Each of those components have very large cardinality. Each individual effector nerve in the individual can lead to a range of actions in continuous space, depending on the frequency and strength of its spike train. The observations are made up of thousands of individual nerve signals. And the hidden state space is potentially enormous. For training of fine-controlled muscle movement, with actions inferred from high precision visual, tactile, and audial sensory information, that scale of modelled markov process is appropriate. However, for higher-order monitoring, rationalisation, and inference of required adjustments, that level of granularity would overwhelm any process that needs to simulate outcomes and consider alternatives. More importantly, that fine-grained level of granularity is unnecessary.

Thus, it is more efficient to apply a high-order re-modelling. In a slight simplification, that can be conceived of as grouping the low-level parts of the modelled markov process as indicated in panel B. That results in a much simpler higher-order model, represented in panel C. For example, our touch sense is really millions of independent nerve endings, but within our conscious perception we think about touch as a single state space with location, texture, amplitude and valence being parameters instead of low-level individual points.

![markov modules](files/A-coherent-theory-v1-markov-modules.drawio.png)

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Markov process modelling.</b> Actions `a`, hidden state `h`, and observations `o`. Lower-case letters refer to low-level fine-granularity, while upper-case letters refer to higher-order abstractions. `m << n`, `k << j`, and `p << q`.</i></li>
</ul>

As an aside: its worth noting that it is likely not just meta-management processes but higher-order planning as a whole that operates at this higher-order level. So while precise control of limb movement, for example, may require the more detailed modelling; overall coordination of actions across the body and CP probably operate a higher-order level.

## Identification of Source

So, meta-management operates against a higher-order representation of action, observation, and hidden state spaces. It is also needs to partition those spaces by their mutual level of interaction (aka mutual information).

Actions in the CP space have no impact on the environment. Actions in the body space influence the environment and the body, and have varying levels of influence over the CP space. Thus, when inferring the best action to take to apply a correction against a non-ideal state, the individual needs to model which modalities of actions are effective against different modalities of state.

Thus the higher-order representations have a strong segmentation between environment, body, and CP in both state and action spaces. Effectively, any sensory information that reaches the attention of higher-order executive and meta-management processes will have a sort of labelling associated with it to identify its source. Events that occur in the environment are labelled as occurring external to the body. Events that occur within the body are labelled as such. Events that occur within CPs are correspondingly labelled.

## Schema

_todo: flesh out:_
- body schema
- cognitive schema


## The Ego in "I"
_todo_

In combination with body schema and cognitive schema, labelling of events leads to a strong association between an event and the schema of its source. So, when I think a thought and subsequently think about having that thought, I know that "I" had that thought.

# II.5 Deeper Dive into Meta-management

In a section above I introduced the idea of meta-management and looked at some of the possible architectures, but I was unable to clearly articulate why one possible architecture is really any different to another. I shall now explain that, by looking more closely at the mechanisms of control and learning.

## Habitual Standard Control Management

Consider the processes required to manage body actions, in what shall here be referred to as standard control management in order to distinguish from meta-management. In the simplest form, a neural network learns a function that maps an action signal from the difference between the desired and actual states. Illustrated below, this is the basis for a habitual system - one that slowly learns to act appropriately for its own advantage over many trial-and-error executions. It lacks any understanding of the mechanisms underlying the environment in which it operates. It lacks the ability to predict accurately in an entirely novel situation. And it lacks the ability to adapt rapidly, should the environment suddenly change in a substantial way.

![Habitual standard management](files/A-coherent-theory-v1-habitual-std-mgmt.drawio.png)

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Habitual System.</b> A neural network predicts the best action given the difference between desired state and actual state. Prediction errors spontaneously cause updates to the relative strengths of neuronal connections.</i></li>
</ul>

Such a system can be extended, for example, to contain an explicit model of the environment and to explicitly model the behaviours and limitations of its own body. With more direct modelling of those independent systems, the system has a greater ability for generalisation, and thus a greater ability to adapt to novel situations. But the system is still fundamentally a habitual one that learns through exposure to many repeated trial-and-error executions.

Learning in such a system is carried out in a relatively well understood way. Prediction errors and positive and negative rewards are fed through the system in the reverse direction (ie: from output layer towards input layer) and they adjust the relative weighting between different neuronal connections. Subsequently, outputs that were associated with more negative outcomes are less likely to occur and outputs that were associated with more positive outcomes are more likely to occur for the same input. The interpretation of feedback signals and application of those learning mechanisms can be orchestrated through innate processes that evolve over thousands and millions of years.

Learning pressure received by the individual may be in the form of pure positive and negative rewards such as satiation of hunger through the finding and consumption of food and such as the pain associated with bodily injury.

Several researchers have suggested that a learned reward system may be layered on top, based on the higher-order modelling of the environment discussed above......[citations, incl. Damasio's book on emotion]........[todo: details]....Those learned feedbacks are particularly useful because they act to shorten the feedback horizon ...[needs explanation]... - by modelling what actions will ultimately lead to future positive and negative rewards, the learned processes provide more frequent feedback than the environment alone. An example is via hormones produced by the endocrine system such as associated with anticipation of reward. This is known to affect learning...[citation]......

_todo: I think this needs to elaborate more on how this system learns and converges, and in particular how it is "inherently convergent":_
- simple innate learning pressure
- active inference as a way of balancing exploration vs exploitation
- simple modelling as a predictive process (inherently convergent)
- simple modelling as input into active inference, and thus providing higher-order learned reward system

## Rational Standard Control Management

Anecdotally, humans seem to possess an additional system that operates in an entirely different way. One which in some cases can produce suitable behaviour from only a single observation of another's behaviour. For shall refer to this as the _rational system_.

We are still a long way from understanding how this system operates, so in order to motive some of the discussion that follows I shall hazard a guess at some of its features, illustrated in the diagram below. As discussed above already, the CPs must utilise multi-step processing, and I believe that is a key part of the rational system. As part of that multi-step processing, I suspect it also learns (likely in a habitual way) a repertoire of strategies for navigating possible CP state paths given different problem domains. It clearly incorporates both short term and long term memories. It also incorporates modelling of other systems, in a way that somehow can incorporate new information from few or even a single example. I believe a key part of that few-shot modelling is based on building up randomly accessible associative relations of higher-order abstract concepts. For example that rain and wetness are associated. And for example, given that relation and a few others, that it is possible to trick another individual into thinking it is raining by spraying water from a hose over their head while they are looking away.

![Rational standard management](files/A-coherent-theory-v1-rational-std-mgmt.drawio.png)

<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;"><i><b>Rational System.</b> Some of the features that might underly rational thought.</i></li>
</ul>

For an individual that lives in a complex environment, the state space trajectories being managed include simple spontaneous sense-action events, and long chains of observation collection, consideration, planning, and sequences of actions. The latter requires rational management in order to cope with the dynamic nature of the environment, and to be able to act on new information after receiving it only once. It also requires rational management in order to cope with complex abstractions in the environment (eg: labels, logic, etc).

_todo: elaborate more on convergence of rational systems:_
- learned learning pressure
- unlikely to have innate pressures
- learning predictive modelling (inherently convergent)
- but few-shot processes may be inherently unstable
- very complex, so large neuronal mass in brain (lots of training required)
- all closely related to why human brain takes so long to mature

## Habitual and Rational Meta-management

What kinds of processes are meta-management made from? Suppose the brain was divided discretely into a habitual region and a rational region, which regions are required for meta-management?

**Habitual processes:**
- The concept of a state-space trajectory planner was proposed earlier. This applies to both standard control (eg: of body state) and meta-management (ie: of CP state).  Largely this can be seen as repeatable strategies for solving problems in different domains, rather than the direct generation of the solutions themselves. As such, the planner is relatively stable and needs only learn slowly. Habitual processes are sufficient. This has the advantage that learned strategies are executed efficiently. Habitual processes also tend to be inherently convergent.

**Rational processes:**
- Meta-management requires domain knowledge to understand even simple things like whether the current thought process is productive. That domain knowledge is largely contained within the rational system.
- Rational processes enable more advanced modelling of one's own mental abilities, plus comparison to others. This motives the individual to improve one's own mental strategies, and thus acts as a powerful learning driver.
- The modeling capabilities of rational processes are required in order to be able to relate external environment events (eg: going to school) to how they can improve one's own mental abilities.
- The few-shot capabilities of the rational processes enable monitoring of newly attempted mental strategies within standard control processes. That is further achieved through access to the same domain knowledge and modelling as used within standard control processes.

The complexity of the rational processes suggests that a large neuronal mass must be required for it to operate. The overlap of domain knowledge required by by both standard control and meta-management processes suggests that they must share access to the same repository system. All up, it seems unlikely that meta-management could evolve in animals as an independent process. The extra neuronal mass required for meta-management to employ its own independent rational system is too energy inefficient to be evolutionarily likely. The complexity of sharing a domain knowledge repository between two independent target systems also seems unlikely. Rather, meta-management must be a fully integrated / inline process with standard control processes.

## Convergence of Meta-Management

The rational meta-management process still appears fundamentally unstable. What learning pressures make it converge towards stability and utility? At this stage I can only offer a few suggestions.

_todo: the description of "narrowing convergent boundaries" and how I've used it aren't quite aligned._

I suspect that interactions between the habitual system, the rational system, and pressures from the external environment, create an effect of narrowing convergent boundaries. With respect to a single learning system, negative and positive feedback from its surroundings causes it to converge towards an optimum behaviour, but that convergence may be slow. If, at the same time, a second system builds up a model of the surroundings and its feedbacks, and if it applies additional feedback on the first system, then it applies a kind of an additional soft boundary against that first system. More importantly, as that second system gradually improves its model, the boundary that it applies to the first also converges. Thus, the range of behaviours of the first system that are allowed by the second system gradually narrows over time.

Panel A in the diagram below illustrates how the external environment and the rational system may act to apply narrowing convergent boundaries against the learning within the habitual system. Feedback signals received from the environment apply an after-the-fact convergent pressure, in the form of negative and positive rewards and in the form of prediction error. When the rational system is operating near its optimum it provides a before-the-fact convergent pressure, in the form of prevention (usually to avoid a catastrophic error occurring) and in the form of encouraging exploration. For example, the individual may have developed a habit of walking a particular route through the forest to the nearest watering hole, but the rational system will prevent that habituated path because it remembers that a tree had fallen and blocked the path at a location that is currently out of sight.

When the rational system is not operating near its optimum, the environment and habitual system act to apply a narrowing convergent boundary, illustrated in Panel B. The external environment applies after-the-fact feedback in the form of positive and negative rewards that the rational system can use for future improvement through both rational adaptation and through whatever underlying learning mechanisms it operates on. As actions become more strongly habituated, it becomes harder for the rational system to counteract them, thus applying a before-the-fact prevention against the most catastrophic errors.

The modalities of environmental pressures requires some further discussion. Discussion in a section above already mentioned pure positive and negative rewards such as hunger satiation and pain. It also mentioned learned higher-order feedback mechanisms that layer on top of those innate learning mechanisms.

One further learning layer exists on top. With such advanced and flexible learning and meta-management comes a high degree of freedom. For example, many different modes of behaviour are potentially equally effective. Most negative short-term outcomes can be adapted to, so that the total outcomes is net positive. This can lead to a high degree of instability - if so many modes of behaviour are equality advantageous, there is little learning pressure to maintain a consistent mode of behaviour. In turn, that can lead to constant re-learning within the habitual system. Ultimately, the individual may converge extremely slowly towards its most optimum set of behaviours. It has been suggested...[citations, including Damasio's emotion book].... that society plays an important role here.

Effectively, society is a collective behavioural exploration and learning system that spans a longer time scale than that of an individual. There are many possible systems of societal norms, and the societies that thrive will tend to have produced systems of societal norms that benefit the society and the individuals within it and those systems will tend to remain relatively stable over time. Through constant feedback from adults and peers, a naive individual's higher order processes are trained to produce behaviours that are consistent with the norms of the society in which they live. That societal pressure thus provides a significant portion of the narrowing convergent boundary exerted by the environment on the individual's learning, particularly for its rational systems including meta-management.
