This page presents an engineering investigation of conscious experience, and forms a consistent explanation that is useful enough for it to be emulated today. A likely architecture for the logical components of high-order thought are presented. It is shown that the content of conscious experience is governed by a representational 'model' upon which all high-order thought is based. It is shown how this theory can explain the majority of the phenomena of consciousness, and it is suggested that this architecture will ultimately form the basis for artificial general intelligence. An investigation of the gaps remaining is also covered.

# Introduction
The "Hard Problem of Consciousness" (Chalmers) has been a conundrum for many centuries. In modern times, disciplines as varied as philosophy, neuroscience, physics, and computer science all discuss the topic. 

The theories here have been developed by considering our current understanding of neuroscience, the characteristics of biological and artificial neural networks, and through introspection.

# Background
(brief lit survey)

# Main
Terminology:
* Online
* Reinforcement
* Offline

## Layers

## Logical Layer

## Virtual Layer

# Analysis
* why conclude all the above

# Why is this useful

* We can build it
* Basis of AGI
* Now that we understand it enough, we can modify it. Eg: learning algorithms don't have to be done exactly the same way. Reinforcement doesn't had to be fine exactly the same way. 

# Gaps in Explanation

* Doesn't explain phenomenal experience 
* Doesn't entirely explain why we don't experience other cyclic regions within in the brain
