> Read my latest manuscript: [Consciousness is a Semiotic Meta-management Feedback Loop]({% link consciousness/Consciousness-is-a-Semiotic-Meta-management-Feedback-Loop.md %})

I'm a software engineer and consciousness enthusiast. Originally from NZ, and now based in Chennai, India. I'm interested in understanding the [Neurocomputational basis of Consciousness]({% link consciousness/0.consciousness-index.md %}), what that tells us about human intelligence, and how to build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

I've been wondering about human consciousness since [2014](https://hometechnician.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/my-theory-on-consciousness/). In particular I'm interested in what creates the 'experience of experiencing'. I seem to observe every thought I make; why do I not just silently process data like a machine? Why is that observation of thought necessary, and what is the thing that does the observing?

In wondering about that, I've always felt that once we could understand consciousness, we would discover that it exists in many forms and levels. In particular, I think consciousness as a phenomenon can exist in systems with highly varying levels of intelligence, and that the strength of that conscious phenomenon is probably tied to the level of intelligence.

My favourite example for a long time has been that of a consciousness with the intelligence of a calculator - a conscious calculator.

It occurred to me in late 2019 that, while I certainly don't think I understand anything significant about human consciousness, I may have formed together enough of a theory that I can actually build something practical.

# Research Projects

## Consciousness
I'm researching the mechanisms underlying consciousness. I believe the lessons learned tell us a lot about how to build the next generation of AGI. [Read more...]({% link consciousness/0.consciousness-index.md %})

## Loopy NNs
My theory of consciousness rests on the idea that multi-iteration processing is a key feature of more advanced intelligence. How do we build neural networks to do the same?

## Learning and Navigation within an Association Space
If an AI agent can learn to navigate in physical space, then it can do so in abstract conceptual space, and start doing rational thought. We just need to figure out a way to learn the conceptual space in an online fashion.
