Welcome to the conscious-calculator wiki!

## Why
I've been wondering about human [consciousness](What-is-Consciousness) for a while now. In particular I'm interested in what creates the 'experience of experiencing'. Why do I not just silently process data like a machine, but instead I observe every thought I make. Why is that observation of thought necessary, and what is the _thing_ that does the observing?

In wondering about that, I've always felt that once we could understand consciousness, we would discover that it exists in many forms and levels. In particular, I think consciousness as a phenomenon can exist in systems with highly varying levels of intelligence, and that the strength of that conscious phenomenon is probably tied to the level of intelligence.

My favourite example for a long time has been that of a consciousness with the intelligence of a calculator - a conscious calculator.

It occurred to me in late 2019 that, while I certainly don't think I understand anything significant about human consciousness, I may have formed together enough of a theory that I can actually build something practical.
