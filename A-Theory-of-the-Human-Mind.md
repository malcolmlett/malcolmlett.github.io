This page describes my overarching theory. Most of the points here are unproven assumptions, based on observations of my own thoughts and influenced from current theories around world.

...work in progress...

Topics:
* All of thought is done by sub-conscious processor modules.
   * Neural pattern matching vs. sequential thought  (vis-a-vis Fast and Slow thinking, Daniel Kahneman)
* Scope of experience of Conscious Thought limited by scope of conscious feedback.
* Consciousness is just a turing machine.
* No free-will - just processors, attention, and meta-thought. The experience of free-will is an artifact of our tightly integrated mental model, and the labeling of its inputs as 'my thoughts'.

## Minimum Requirements
I believe the most basic form of consciousness needs only the following:
* feedback loop: current state of thought is fed back as an input
* "experience of experiencing" - whatever that is, it's fundamentally important

In practice, it turns out there are some other requirements, without which consciousness doesn't produce anything interesting, and would never have evolved in biological forms:
* sufficiently interesting inputs (senses)
* some form of 'current state' like working memory (this is the 'state' part of a turing machine)
* a minimum level of intelligence
* short to long term memory (required for a useful level of intelligence)

## Why is individual intelligence limited?
The architecture I have theorised does not imply any limits. I believe the same architecture is used throughout all mammals at the least, to varying scales. But clearly the DNA of a species puts limits on the capacity of an individual to increase their intelligence. But why? Why is it that a dog cannot learn to be as intelligent as a human? 

An answer to this may lie in the fundamental difference between what is controlled by DNA and what is learned. 

DNA must set some controls on regions of the brain. The visual system presumably cannot be re-purposed to rationalise about thermal systems. And that makes sense - the visual processing system is architected with a focus on visual inputs...so it's learning is focused on that. 

Additionally, learning requires a fitness measure, which will likely be heavily controlled by DNA with little, if any, adjustments possible from life experiences. The fitness measure of each region is brain will be heavily focused on a particular task. This likely explains why the brain seems so conveniently modular - learning is more efficient when focused on one thing.

So the limits of an individual's intelligence growth are imposed by the specific focused tasks that evolution has selected for.

A concrete example may actually lie in the way that we _can_ increase intelligence to an extent. Individual regions of brain can increase in size. For example London cabbies, with their enlarged memory centre. But it is likely that our biology imposes limits on that growth. Any fitness function will incorporate efficiency, and there is an inherent trade-off between size and efficiency. The limit is "soft", and can be stretched, but only so far. 

Beyond that, each brain region had an inherent capacity. This is like a (roughly) fixed number of neurons that can learn anything its given, but only to the resolution possible within that number of neurons.
