This page describes my overarching theory. Most of the points here are unproven assumptions, based on observations of my own thoughts and influenced from current theories around world.

...work in progress...

Topics:
* All of thought is done by sub-conscious processor modules.
   * Neural pattern matching vs. sequential thought  (vis-a-vis Fast and Slow thinking, Daniel Kahneman)
* Scope of experience of Conscious Thought limited by scope of conscious feedback.
* Consciousness is just a turing machine.
* No free-will - just processors, attention, and meta-thought.
