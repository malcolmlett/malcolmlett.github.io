This page describes my overarching theory. Most of the points here are unproven assumptions, based on observations of my own thoughts and influenced from current theories around world.

...work in progress...

Topics:
* All of thought is done by sub-conscious processor modules.
   * Neural pattern matching vs. sequential thought  (vis-a-vis Fast and Slow thinking, Daniel Kahneman)
* Scope of experience of Conscious Thought limited by scope of conscious feedback.
* Consciousness is just a turing machine.
* No free-will - just processors, attention, and meta-thought.

## Minimum Requirements
I believe the most basic form of consciousness needs only the following:
* feedback loop: current state of thought is fed back as an input
* "experience of experiencing" - whatever that is, it's fundamentally important

In practice, it turns out there are some other requirements, without which consciousness doesn't produce anything interesting, and would never have evolved in biological forms:
* sufficiently interesting inputs (senses)
* some form of 'current state' like working memory (this is the 'state' part of a turing machine)
* a minimum level of intelligence
* short to long term memory (required for a useful level of intelligence)
