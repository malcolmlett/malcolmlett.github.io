# Part I - Background

What is consciousness? This a question that has been considered for a long time. When Chalmers now famously re-phrased it as the "hard problem of consciousness", he went so far as to claim that no currently known mechanism can produce the phenomenon of subjective experience.

# I.1 Theories of Consciousness

Many theories exist about the nature of consciousness. A summary of such theories will be given here. To provide some uniformity, the explanatory framework of a stack of theoretical layers is used, illustrated in the following diagram. Here, the physical biology of the brain is viewed as a substrate that might potentially be replaced or emulated via some other substrate (eg: silicon neurons). Built upon that substrate are many non-conscious processes. Either directly from the underlying substrate, or as a result of the non-conscious processes, some mental states are associated with subjective experience. The blue boxes represent potential layers involved in that subjective experience. For example, some non-conscious processes may produce representations that are associated with subjective experience. Such representations may or may not require specific functional structures in order to lead to subjective experience. Additionally, even with appropriate functional structures, something extra special may or may not be needed in order for those representations to be associated with subjective experience.

</ul>

**Substrate:** Everything is constructed within a physical substrate such as biological neurons. Identity Theory posits that there may be something special about biological neurons that give rise to subjective experience; or in other words, that functional isomorphisms of biological neurons such as silicon neurons or computer simulated neurons will never produce subjective experience. Inspired by the peculiar behaviour of quantum mechanics, some have suggested that the physical substrate produces quantum entanglement and that this quantum entanglement may be the underlying mechanism behind subjective experience, such as  ...{insert name of Microtubules theory}.... Such theories are quiet on which of the other layers are required. Those theories bare some similarity to that of Pan-Psychism, the theory that consciousness is fundamental in the same way that physical forces and energies are fundamental. Under Pan-psychism, some non-conscious processes lead directly to subjective experience with pan-psychist properties providing the "something special" without necessarily requiring specific representations or functional structures. However, pan-psychism is unable to explain why only certain processes are associated with subjective experience while others are not. An obvious explanation would be to require that only certain representations and associated functional structures are sufficient to "combine" the conscious properties of independent neurons / molecules / atoms, but this still leads many open questions about what those representations and/or functional structures might be that have such a power over this underlying fundamental consciousness.

**Non-conscious processes:** Many processes operate that neither directly nor indirectly lead to any kind of conscious subjective experience. While earlier work assumed that most brain processes are conscious, there is increasingly strong evidence that almost all mental processes are non-conscious, even for mental processes that are associated with attentive subjective experience. The furthest logical extension is that of epi-phenomenalism which posits that no functional mental processes are associated with subjective experience. Rather, subjective experience is posited as being some sort of non-causal summary of internal and external events. A significant problem with epi-phenomenalism is why subjective experience, and indeed consciousness at all, would have evolved if it can provide no functional / causal benefit to the individual. In that sense, epi-phenomenalism only makes any sense if viewed in conjunction with pas-psychism or with metaphysical dualistic theories where some "spirit" that exists on another plane of reality are perceiving the experiences for some grander purpose outside of the context of the corporeal reality.

**Representation:** Under Computational Representation Theories of Consciousness, some of those non-conscious processes produce representations that are associated with subjective experience. Debates within this area are about the kinds of these representations. For example, the intransitive vs transitive debate questions whether it is sufficient that a representation is simply held in attention or whether the representation must be in relation to the individual.......{needs work and better tie-back to actual theories}....

**Functional Structures:** The next question arises about why certain representations would have subjective experience and others would not. Is it sufficient that a particular kind of representation exists for it to be associated with subjective experience, or does that representation need to occur in conjunction with particular functional structures? For example, imagine that all aspects of the brain were understood to the point that we could identify exactly which representations are associated with subjective experience. Now imagine that an exact replica of a particular representation was encoded within the gates of a silicon memory chip within a computer. Most would argue that the silicon memory chip does not subsequently have subjective experience of that representation, because a representational state alone is insufficient for subjective experience. Some kind of functional structure presumably must be required to observe that representation. But if functional structures are indeed required, what are those functional structures? And what distinguishes those functional structures that are associated with subjective experience and those that are not? Once again here it can be hard to avoid the pitfall of infinite regress: if a representation must be interpreted in order to be perceived, and a functional structure is required in order to interpret that representation, what is the output of that interpretation if it is not just another representation needing to be further interpreted?

**Something Special:** A deeper philosophical debate rages about whether representation and functional structures alone are sufficient to produce subjective experience, or whether something else is required. In the example below, if all the representational and functional structures are in place for an individual to have both the external behaviours and internal mental behaviours of an individual in intense pain, can we even conceive it to be possible that they would not have the typical associated subjective experience of the pain?

> Suppose that, in order to avoid the risks to his patient of anaesthesia, a resourceful surgeon finds a way of temporarily depriving the patient of whatever nonfunctional condition the critic of functionalism insists on, while keeping the functional organization of the patient’s brain intact. As the surgeon proceeds with, say, a massive abdominal operation, the patient’s functional organization might lead him to think that he is in acute pain and to very much prefer that he not be, even though the surgeon assures him that he could not be in pain because he has been deprived of precisely “what it takes.” It is hard to believe that even the most ardent qualiaphile would be satisfied by such assurances.

One particular area of debate falls variously under the terms "Cartesian theatre" or "homunculus problem". The Cartesian Theatre ..introduced by ....describes the interactions between supposedly two parts of the mind: the part that has subjective experience (the audience in the theatre), and the part that produces the contents of subjective experience (the actors in the theatre). This has also been described as a "homunculus" or "little man" inside the brain that has the experiences. Both descriptions pose a problem: that the audience/homonculus requires a significant level of intelligence in order to interpret and understand the show being put on; but that same intelligence is required to produce the show in the first place. In the case of homunculus, we can provide two descriptions w.r.t. to the layers described above. In the first description, the non-conscious processes produce a representation that is perceived by the homunculus. Here the problem becomes what mechanisms the homunculus uses to do that perceiving? In the second description, the representation is sufficiently processed by functional structures so that no further processing is required, and that final result is simply perceived-without-processing. In practice this raises more questions than it seeks to address. What kind of thing is it that can perceive-without-processing? In response, the theory of semiotics (discussed in a section below) claims that it is impossible for such a thing to exist, because there is no perception without interpretation, and interpretation necessarily involves processing.

Ned Block and various other's variations propose that consciousness is divided into access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness, and that access-consciousness variously stops somewhere below the "something special" layer, with various arguments about where it stops. Such arguments down to differences in opinion about the relation between access and phenomenal consciousness: i) are they one-to-one: all access conscious events have phenomenal consciousness, ii) can some access conscious events lead to external behaviour without the individual having subjective experience?, or iii) can some phenomenal conscious events occur that have no access consciousness: for example that the individual experiences in the moment but cannot have any memory of it and cannot report on it.
